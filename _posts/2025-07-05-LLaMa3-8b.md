Llama 3 8B excels in instruction following and generating structured outputs like JSON. Compared to models like Gemma, it delivers more accurate and reliable responses. Its performance and alignment make it ideal for real-world, prompt-driven applications.

# LLaMa vs Gemma

If our prompts are working well with **LLaMA** but not with **Gemma**, despite being relatively concise and structured, the issue is likely due to **differences in training data, instruction tuning, and architectural behavior**.

Let‚Äôs break down **why** and how to **adapt your approach**:

### üîç Why LLaMA Works Better than Gemma

| Factor                         | **LLaMA 3**                             | **Gemma (2B/7B)**                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Instruction tuning**         | Heavily tuned for instructions & format | Lighter instruction tuning                |
| **Reasoning capability**       | Strong general reasoning                | Simpler chain-of-thought behavior         |
| **Training data**              | Broad and diverse (code, instructions)  | Cleaner but narrower dataset              |
| **System prompt expectations** | Works well without explicit structure   | Often benefits from explicit task framing |
| **Parsing robustness**         | Good with structured JSON               | Tends to miss format expectations         |

# LLaMa 3.1 8B

The **official** `meta‚Äëllama/Llama‚Äë3.1‚Äë8B‚ÄëInstruct` available on Hugging Face is **not quantized by default**‚Äîit‚Äôs the full-precision model (\~FP16/FP32). However, the community has provided alternative quantized versions (e.g., ZeroWw‚Äôs GGUF quantizations) that you can download separately ([huggingface.co][1]).

From the discussions on that model page, here are the typical GPU memory requirements:

| Use Case                        | GPU Memory Required                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Run 4-bit quantized version** | \~6‚ÄØGB VRAM          ([huggingface.co][2]) |
| **Fine-tune in 4-bit**          | ‚â•‚ÄØ15‚ÄØGB VRAM                               |
| **Run full model (FP16/FP32)**  | ‚â•‚ÄØ16‚ÄØGB VRAM                               |

### ‚úÖ Summary

* **Is the HF model quantized?**
  No‚Äîthe default is full precision. You‚Äôd need to manually choose a community quantized version.

* **Needed GPU memory:**

  * \~6‚ÄØGB if you use a **4-bit quantized** variant
  * > \=‚ÄØ16‚ÄØGB for the **full model**
  * > \=‚ÄØ15‚ÄØGB if you want to **fine-tune** in 4-bit

### ‚úÖ What Distillation Typically Gives You

| Benefit                         | Applies to Your Case?                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Smaller size**                | Yes ‚Äî if you're tight on resources         |
| **Faster inference**            | Yes ‚Äî especially with quantized models     |
| **Retained general capability** | Partially ‚Äî but lower than full LLaMA 3 8B |
| **Lower cost to deploy**        | Yes ‚Äî helpful if hosting models            |

But distillation **compresses general knowledge and ability**, often at the cost of **structured precision**, **format consistency**, and **long-context handling** ‚Äî exactly the traits that matter for **JSON-to-JSON pipelines**.

---

### ‚ùå What You Likely *Lose* with Distilled Models

| Loss Area                      | Impact for JSON Tasks                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Precision in output format** | High impact (more format drift)                                     |
| **Structured reasoning depth** | Medium to high                                                      |
| **Long context fidelity**      | High (many distilled models only support 4k‚Äì32k)                    |
| **Consistency on edge cases**  | High ‚Äî distilled models are less reliable under complex input rules |

---

### üü® Exception: Distilled Models Tuned *Specifically* for Structure

If you found a distilled model that was:

* Fine-tuned specifically for **structured data I/O**
* Supports **128k context** natively
* Has **validated consistency in JSON output**

Then yes ‚Äî it **might** outperform a base LLaMA 3 on your task.

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion:

> **Stick with LLaMA 3 8B** ‚Äî distilled LLaMA variants won‚Äôt likely add value for your structured JSON workflow.

## LLama 3.1 8B on Customer Grade GPUs

Here‚Äôs what people are reporting for **LLaMA 3‚Äôs 8B model performance** on RTX‚ÄØ3090 and RTX‚ÄØ4090:

---

## üß† RTX‚ÄØ4090

Redditors and benchmarkers consistently note strong results:

* A Reddit user summarized testing performance on a 4090 (likely with vLLM or TGI backend), though they didn‚Äôt share exact numbers ([reddit.com][1], [vast.ai][2]).
* The community benchmark repository by XiongjieDai reports around **127.7‚ÄØtokens/sec (quantized Q4\_K\_M)** and **54.3‚ÄØtokens/sec (FP16)** on LLaMA 3.8B using llama.cpp ([github.com][3]).
* A vLLM performance test shows total throughput \~7000 tokens/sec (sum of input + output) for ‚ÄúLlama-8B‚Äù on 4090 ([databasemart.com][4]).

To sum it up:

* **\~125 t/s (Q4 quant)**
* **\~50‚Äì55 t/s (FP16)**

---

## üöÄ RTX‚ÄØ3090

Benchmarks include:

* From XiongjieDai‚Äôs tests:

  * **111.7 t/s (Q4\_K\_M)**
  * **46.5 t/s (FP16)** ([pugetsystems.com][5], [github.com][3], [reddit.com][1]).
* A YouTuber using LM Studio with a 3090 reported **\~60 t/s** on LLaMA 3 8B ([youtube.com][6]).
* A Reddit user noted \~99 t/s on LLaMA 3 8B-Q4 variant with no power limit, dropping slightly to 91 t/s at reduced power ([reddit.com][7]).

So typical numbers:

* **‚àº60‚Äì112 t/s (Q4 quant)**
* **‚àº46 t/s (FP16)**

## üìä Comparison Table

| GPU      | Quantized Q4‚ÄØ(K/M)          | FP16     |
| -------- | --------------------------- | -------- |
| RTX‚ÄØ4090 | \~127 t/s                   | \~54 t/s |
| RTX‚ÄØ3090 | \~112 t/s (99‚Äì60 t/s range) | \~46 t/s |

* **5090‚Äì4090 difference**: \~10‚Äì20‚ÄØ% faster in quantized mode, similar PF16 gains.
* **Best performance**: RTX‚ÄØ4090 slightly ahead, but both are solid for LLaMA 3.
* **Quantization is key** to fit 8B on 16‚Äì24GB cards and unlock speed advantages.

---

## üîß Format & Backend Notes

* Most benchmarks use **Q4\_K\_M** quantization via llama.cpp, delivering \~110‚Äì130 t/s.
* FP16 (unquantized) tops out around **46‚Äì55 t/s**, but may OOM on 16GB cards.
* Throughput depends on backend (e.g., llama.cpp vs. vLLM, TGI, llm.cpp).

---

### ‚úÖ TL;DR

* **RTX‚ÄØ4090**: \~‚Å£127‚ÄØt/s (Q4), \~54‚ÄØt/s (FP16)
* **RTX‚ÄØ3090**: \~‚Å£112‚ÄØt/s (Q4), \~46‚ÄØt/s (FP16)
* **Quantized Q4 is highly recommended** ‚Äî it offers the best speed and VRAM efficiency for LLaMA‚ÄØ3‚ÄØ8B.
