Quorum queues are a modern queue type in RabbitMQ (introduced in version 3.8.0) designed to provide data safety through replication and exactly-once processing semantics through built-in message deduplication.

## Core Characteristics

1. **Raft-Based Implementation**:
   - Uses the Raft consensus protocol for leader election and log replication
   - All queue operations go through the leader node
   - Automatically handles failover when the leader becomes unavailable

2. **Message Replication**:
   - Messages are replicated to a majority (quorum) of nodes
   - Default replication factor is all cluster nodes (configurable)

3. **Exactly-Once Semantics**:
   - Provides built-in message deduplication
   - Uses `x-message-deduplication-id` header for identifying duplicates

## Deduplication Mechanism

### How It Works

1. **Message Identification**:
   ```python
   channel.basic_publish(
       exchange='my_exchange',
       routing_key='my_queue',
       body=message_body,
       properties=pika.BasicProperties(
           headers={'x-message-deduplication-id': 'unique_id_123'}
       )
   )
   ```

2. **Deduplication Window**:
   - Messages with the same deduplication ID are filtered out
   - Deduplication occurs within a configurable time window

3. **Storage Backend**:
   - Deduplication information is stored in the queue's internal state
   - Replicated across all queue replicas for consistency

### Configuration Options

1. **Enabling Deduplication**:
   ```java
   Map<String, Object> args = new HashMap<>();
   args.put("x-queue-type", "quorum");
   args.put("x-message-deduplication", true);
   channel.queueDeclare("dedup-queue", true, false, false, args);
   ```

2. **Key Parameters**:
   - `x-message-ttl`: Sets how long deduplication information is retained
   - `x-max-length`: Limits queue size while maintaining deduplication
   - `x-delivery-limit`: Controls how many times a message can be redelivered

## Performance Considerations

1. **Throughput Impact**:
   - Typically 10-40% lower throughput than classic mirrored queues
   - Higher latency due to consensus requirements

2. **Resource Usage**:
   - Higher memory consumption due to message tracking
   - Disk I/O increased by write-ahead logging

3. **Optimization Tips**:
   - Adjust `x-quorum-initial-group-size` for smaller clusters
   - Tune `x-max-in-memory-length` for memory-sensitive deployments
   - Consider separate disk for WAL files

## Use Cases Where Quorum Queues Excel

1. **Critical Financial Transactions**:
   - Where duplicate processing could cause financial discrepancies

2. **Order Processing Systems**:
   - Ensuring each order is processed exactly once

3. **Inventory Management**:
   - Preventing duplicate inventory deductions

4. **Audit Trail Systems**:
   - Where duplicate messages would corrupt audit integrity

## Limitations to Consider

1. **No Lazy Loading**:
   - All messages are kept in memory up to `x-max-in-memory-length`

2. **Cluster Requirements**:
   - Requires odd number of nodes (3, 5, etc.) for proper quorum

3. **No Per-Message Priority**:
   - Priority queues are not supported in quorum queues

4. **Non-Atomic Operations**:
   - Transactions are not supported (use publisher confirms instead)

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Key Metrics to Watch**:
   - `quorum_queue_leader_changes`
   - `quorum_queue_unreachable_replicas`
   - `quorum_queue_messages_ram` vs `quorum_queue_messages_persisted`

2. **Management Commands**:
   ```bash
   rabbitmq-queues rebalance quorum
   rabbitmq-diagnostics quorum_status
   ```

3. **Troubleshooting Tips**:
   - Leader failures trigger automatic reelection
   - Network partitions may require manual intervention
   - Monitor disk space for WAL growth
