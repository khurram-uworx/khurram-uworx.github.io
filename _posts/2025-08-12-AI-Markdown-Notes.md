Microsoft OneNote‚Äôs slow pace in innovation‚Äîespecially compared to newer AI-driven note-taking tools like Notion, Obsidian, or Tana‚Äîboils down to a few key factors:

1. **Legacy Infrastructure**: OneNote is deeply tied to the Microsoft ecosystem, which includes legacy code, backward compatibility, and integration with Office products. This makes rapid innovation more difficult.

2. **Enterprise Focus**: Microsoft tends to prioritize stability, compliance, and scalability for its massive enterprise base. Radical UI/UX changes or experimental AI features could disrupt workflows or introduce risk.

3. **Internal Priorities**: Microsoft has been heavily investing in AI at the platform level (Copilot, Azure OpenAI, etc.), focusing first on products like Word, Excel, and Teams. OneNote has received less attention in this rollout.

4. **Product Fragmentation**: There are multiple versions of OneNote (Windows 10 app vs. Office version), which has caused confusion and slowed development. Microsoft has only recently started consolidating them.

5. **Complacency from Market Share**: OneNote has long been a default tool in education and corporate settings. That built-in user base can reduce pressure to evolve quickly, especially with limited direct competition from established vendors.

In contrast, newer players are:

* Building from scratch with modern tech stacks.
* Targeting niche audiences and power users.
* Shipping features fast (especially AI integrations).
* Prioritizing delightful, clean user interfaces.

Unless Microsoft gives OneNote a dedicated AI/UX overhaul team, it risks being seen as a stagnant option while nimble competitors dominate the next-gen note-taking space.

If your LLM-generated notes are in **Markdown**, you‚Äôre in a great position‚ÄîMarkdown is lightweight, portable, and widely supported. Here‚Äôs where you should consider storing them, based on your priorities:

* **Filesystem**: Store in a synced folder (Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud).
* **GitHub / GitLab**: Great for version control of knowledge bases or LLM outputs.

### üîÅ Bonus: Automate LLM ‚Üí Markdown ‚Üí Note App

* **Use cases**:

  * Run a script that pulls LLM output and saves to Markdown.
  * Auto-sync into Obsidian vault or Git repo.
  * Use a service like [Readwise + Obsidian plugin](https://help.readwise.io/article/175-obsidian-integration) to ingest highlights/AI outputs.

**TL;DR**:
For full Markdown support and modern workflows, **Obsidian**, **Logseq**, or **VS Code** are your best bets. If you need collaborative, UI-rich experiences, **Notion** is workable but not Markdown-native. Keep your notes portable, versioned, and searchable‚ÄîMarkdown makes that easy.
