### 🔍 What are NP Problems?

**NP** stands for **Nondeterministic Polynomial time**.

#### ✅ Definition:

A problem is in **NP** if:

* **Given a candidate solution**, we can **verify its correctness in polynomial time**.

This doesn't mean we can *find* the solution quickly, only that we can *check* one quickly.

---

### 🧠 Think of it this way:

* **P problems**: You can solve them quickly (in polynomial time).
* **NP problems**: You may not be able to solve them quickly, but if someone gives you a solution, you can check if it's correct quickly.

---

### 📦 Example: Subset Sum

> Given a set of numbers and a target sum, does any subset add up to the target?

* **Hard to solve**: You might need to try many combinations.
* **Easy to verify**: If someone gives you a subset, you can add the numbers and check the sum.

So, **Subset Sum is in NP**.

### 🕵️ Why “Nondeterministic”?

Imagine a computer that can "magically guess" the right answer (nondeterminism). If there *exists* a correct solution, it can guess it and verify it quickly.

In theory:

* An **NP machine** guesses a solution.
* Then verifies it in polynomial time.

### Summary:

| Term            | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P**           | Problems solvable in polynomial time                                                |
| **NP**          | Problems verifiable in polynomial time                                              |
| **NP-Complete** | Hardest problems in NP; if you solve one quickly, you solve all NP problems quickly |

### ✅ What is an NP-Complete Problem?

An NP-Complete (NPC) problem satisfies **two** key conditions:

1. **Belongs to NP**:
   The problem can be *verified* in polynomial time. That is, if someone gives you a candidate solution, you can check whether it's correct efficiently (in polynomial time).

2. **NP-Hard**:
   Every problem in NP can be **reduced** to it in polynomial time. This means if we can solve this problem efficiently, we can solve *all* NP problems efficiently.

In essence, NP-Complete problems are the "hardest" problems in NP. If any NP-Complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then **P = NP**.

### 🧭 Why the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP - Decision Version)** is NP-Complete

Let’s look at the **decision version** of TSP (not the optimization one):

> Given a complete graph with distances and a number `k`, is there a tour that visits each city once, returns to the start, and has total distance ≤ `k`?

#### 1. **It’s in NP**

If someone gives you a proposed tour (sequence of cities), you can:

* Check if all cities are visited exactly once
* Verify if the total distance is ≤ `k`
  All of this can be done in polynomial time ⇒ **in NP**.

#### 2. **It’s NP-Hard**

We can reduce other known NP-Complete problems to TSP. One common approach:

* Reduce **Hamiltonian Cycle** (which is NP-Complete) to TSP.
* Construct a graph where the TSP tour corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle with edge weights set cleverly (e.g., 1 for original edges, a large number for non-edges).

Thus, since:

* TSP (Decision) is in NP
* Hamiltonian Cycle ≤p TSP
  ⇒ **TSP (Decision) is NP-Complete**

Here are some interesting NP-Complete problems that are accessible and relevant to computer engineers:

1. **Traveling Salesman Problem (Decision Version)**
   *Given a list of cities and distances between each pair, is there a route shorter than a given value that visits each city exactly once and returns to the start?*

2. **Knapsack Problem (0/1 version)**
   *Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, can you select a subset of items that fit within a given weight limit and reach at least a certain total value?*

3. **Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)**
   *Given a Boolean formula, is there an assignment of true/false values to variables that makes the formula true?*

4. **Graph Coloring (k-coloring)**
   *Can the nodes of a graph be colored using at most k colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color?*

5. **Vertex Cover**
   *Given a graph and a number k, is there a set of k or fewer vertices such that every edge in the graph has at least one endpoint in that set?*

6. **Subset Sum**
   *Given a set of integers, is there a subset whose sum equals a target number?*

7. **Job Scheduling (with deadlines and profits)**
   *Given a set of jobs with deadlines and profits, can you select a subset to schedule so that you don’t miss deadlines and maximize total profit?*

8. **Hamiltonian Cycle**
   *Does a given graph contain a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting point?*

9. **3-Partition Problem**
   *Can a multiset of integers be partitioned into triples that all sum to the same value?*

10. **Bin Packing**
    *Given items of different sizes and a fixed bin size, can you pack all items using at most a certain number of bins?*
