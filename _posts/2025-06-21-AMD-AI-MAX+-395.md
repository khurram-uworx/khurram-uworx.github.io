**"The AMD AI Max+ 395 is to AI PCs what the Pentium was to multimedia PCs."**

---

* The **Intel Pentium** was a *defining CPU era* for consumer computing and multimedia in the 90s. It became synonymous with performance and a major leap forward.
* The **AMD AI Max+ 395** seems to be AMD's flagship push into the **AI PC** era ‚Äî so the comparison is trying to say it's a *breakthrough processor defining a new category*.

If AMD's chip indeed becomes widely adopted and shapes the AI PC market, then yes ‚Äî the analogy could hold. Right now, it's more **aspirational** than fact, but it's a **valid viewpoint**.

## Is 2000$ AI PC Expensive?

In **1996**, a PC with a **Pentium 100 MHz**, a **4x CD-ROM drive**, and a **Sound Blaster sound card** was considered a **Multimedia PC (MPC)** ‚Äî a premium setup for home users.

---

### üí∞ **Estimated Cost of a MPC Setup (1996)**

Here‚Äôs a rough cost breakdown:

| Component                          | Estimated Price (USD, 1996) |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Intel Pentium 100 MHz CPU          | \$500‚Äì\$700                 |
| Motherboard (Socket 5/7)           | \$150‚Äì\$200                 |
| 16‚Äì32 MB RAM                       | \$100‚Äì\$250                 |
| 1 GB Hard Drive                    | \$200‚Äì\$300                 |
| 4x CD-ROM Drive                    | \$150‚Äì\$250                 |
| Sound Blaster 16 or AWE32 Card     | \$100‚Äì\$250                 |
| VGA Graphics Card (1‚Äì2 MB)         | \$100‚Äì\$200                 |
| 15" CRT Monitor                    | \$300‚Äì\$500                 |
| Case + Power Supply + Floppy Drive | \$100‚Äì\$150                 |
| Keyboard + Mouse                   | \$50                        |
| **Total**                          | **\~\$1,800‚Äì\$2,800**       |

---

### üíª **Average PC Cost in 1996**

* A **basic non-MPC PC** (e.g., with a 486 or low-end Pentium, no CD-ROM or sound card) could cost around **\$1,200‚Äì\$1,500**.
* The **average consumer PC** price in 1996 was roughly **\$1,800**, but could vary depending on vendor and config.
* **MPC-certified PCs** often cost **\$300‚Äì\$800 more** than non-MPCs.

---

### üéØ **Conclusion: MPC Premium**

A consumer in 1996 paid around **20‚Äì40% premium** for a fully-equipped **MPC**, mainly due to:

* The CD-ROM (still not standard in all PCs)
* Sound card (vital for multimedia/games)
* Higher-end CPU and RAM

The **MPC spec** was marketed heavily for accessing **CD-ROM software**, **educational content**, **games**, and early multimedia titles like **Encarta** or **Myst** ‚Äî so people paid a premium for future-proofing.
