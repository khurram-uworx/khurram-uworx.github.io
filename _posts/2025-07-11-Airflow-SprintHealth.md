### Project Idea: Jira Sprint Health Monitor with Automated Alerts

**Objective**: Build an Airflow pipeline that monitors a Jira sprint’s health by analyzing issue progress, detecting blockers, and escalating problems to the team or managers via Slack or email. Instead of just generating a static report, this pipeline actively tracks sprint dynamics and takes action—something a simple script can’t scale to handle effectively.

**Why This Is Interesting**:
- It’s proactive: Identifies risks (e.g., stalled tasks, overdue issues) and notifies the team automatically.
- It leverages Airflow’s strengths: Handles multiple dependent tasks, retries failed API calls, and integrates with external systems (Jira + Slack/email).
- It solves a real pain point: Sprint health can slip unnoticed, and manual checks are tedious—automation here saves time and prevents surprises.

---

### Project Breakdown

#### What the Pipeline Does
1. **Extract**: Fetch Jira sprint data (issues, statuses, assignees, last-updated timestamps).
2. **Analyze**: 
   - Calculate sprint velocity (e.g., completed story points vs. planned).
   - Identify stalled issues (e.g., "In Progress" for >3 days with no updates).
   - Flag overdue issues (past due date and still open).
3. **Act**: 
   - Post a summary of sprint health to a Slack channel.
   - If critical issues are detected (e.g., too many blockers), escalate with a detailed email to the team lead.

#### Why Airflow Makes Sense Here
- **Dependency Management**: Fetching data must happen before analysis, and notifications depend on analysis results.
- **Scheduling**: Runs daily (or more often) to catch problems early, with retries if Jira’s API fails.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add more checks or integrations (e.g., GitHub PR status, team calendar).
- **Monitoring**: Airflow’s UI tracks task success/failure, so engineers can debug issues like API outages.

#### Tools and Prerequisites
- **Apache Airflow**: Local or server setup.
- **Python Libraries**: `jira` (API access), `pandas` (data analysis), `slack_sdk` (Slack integration), `airflow.providers.smtp` (email).
- **Jira API Access**: Same as before (URL, email, API token).
- **Slack Webhook**: For posting to a channel (get from Slack’s API settings).

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Set Up Environment
- Install Airflow and dependencies: `pip install apache-airflow jira pandas slack_sdk airflow.providers.smtp`.
- Configure credentials: Store Jira API token, Slack webhook, and SMTP settings in Airflow Variables (via UI or CLI).

#### 2. Write the DAG File
Create `jira_sprint_monitor.py` in the `dags/` folder.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.operators.email import EmailOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from jira import JIRA
import pandas as pd
from slack_sdk import WebhookClient

default_args = {
    'owner': 'software_team',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'email_on_failure': True,
    'email': ['team-lead@example.com'],
    'retries': 3,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
}

# Define the DAG
dag = DAG(
    'jira_sprint_monitor',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='Monitor Jira sprint health and alert on issues',
    schedule_interval='0 9 * * *',  # Daily at 9 AM
    start_date=datetime(2025, 2, 26),
    catchup=False,
)

# Task 1: Fetch Jira data
def fetch_jira_data():
    jira = JIRA(server='https://your-domain.atlassian.net', basic_auth=('your-email@example.com', 'your-api-token'))
    issues = jira.search_issues('project = YOUR_PROJECT_KEY AND sprint in openSprints()', maxResults=100)
    data = [{
        'key': issue.key,
        'summary': issue.fields.summary,
        'status': issue.fields.status.name,
        'assignee': issue.fields.assignee.displayName if issue.fields.assignee else 'Unassigned',
        'story_points': issue.fields.customfield_10020 or 0,  # Adjust custom field ID for story points
        'updated': issue.fields.updated,
        'due_date': issue.fields.duedate
    } for issue in issues]
    return data

# Task 2: Analyze sprint health
def analyze_sprint_health(ti):
    data = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='fetch_jira_data')
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    
    # Calculate velocity
    total_points = df['story_points'].sum()
    done_points = df[df['status'] == 'Done']['story_points'].sum()
    velocity = done_points / total_points if total_points > 0 else 0
    
    # Detect stalled issues (no update in 3+ days)
    df['updated'] = pd.to_datetime(df['updated'])
    now = pd.Timestamp.now(tz='UTC')
    stalled = df[(df['status'] == 'In Progress') & ((now - df['updated']).dt.days > 3)]
    
    # Detect overdue issues
    df['due_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['due_date'])
    overdue = df[(df['due_date'].notnull()) & (df['due_date'] < now) & (df['status'] != 'Done')]
    
    # Summary
    summary = {
        'velocity': f"{velocity:.0%}",
        'stalled_count': len(stalled),
        'overdue_count': len(overdue),
        'stalled_issues': stalled[['key', 'summary']].to_dict('records'),
        'overdue_issues': overdue[['key', 'summary']].to_dict('records'),
    }
    return summary

# Task 3: Post to Slack
def post_to_slack(ti):
    summary = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='analyze_sprint_health')
    slack_webhook = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url'  # Replace with your webhook
    client = WebhookClient(slack_webhook)
    
    message = (
        f"*Sprint Health Update*\n"
        f"- Velocity: {summary['velocity']} completed\n"
        f"- Stalled Issues: {summary['stalled_count']}\n"
        f"- Overdue Issues: {summary['overdue_count']}"
    )
    client.send(text=message)

# Task 4: Escalate if critical
def escalate_if_critical(ti):
    summary = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='analyze_sprint_health')
    if summary['stalled_count'] > 5 or summary['overdue_count'] > 3:  # Thresholds
        return True
    return False

# Define tasks
fetch_task = PythonOperator(task_id='fetch_jira_data', python_callable=fetch_jira_data, dag=dag)
analyze_task = PythonOperator(task_id='analyze_sprint_health', python_callable=analyze_sprint_health, dag=dag)
slack_task = PythonOperator(task_id='post_to_slack', python_callable=post_to_slack, dag=dag)
check_critical_task = PythonOperator(task_id='check_critical', python_callable=escalate_if_critical, dag=dag)

email_task = EmailOperator(
    task_id='send_escalation_email',
    to='team-lead@example.com',
    subject='Critical Sprint Issues Detected',
    html_content="""<h3>Critical Sprint Health Alert</h3>
                    <p>Too many stalled or overdue issues detected. Check the Slack update for details.</p>""",
    dag=dag,
    trigger_rule='one_success',  # Only runs if check_critical returns True
)

# Set dependencies
fetch_task >> analyze_task >> [slack_task, check_critical_task]
check_critical_task >> email_task
```

#### 3. Explanation of Changes
- **Fetch**: Now grabs more data (story points, due dates) for richer analysis.
- **Analyze**: Calculates velocity and flags stalled/overdue issues—real sprint health insights.
- **Slack**: Posts a concise update to the team’s channel, making it interactive and visible.
- **Escalation**: Conditionally sends an email if things look bad, showing Airflow’s ability to branch logic.
- **Retries**: Added to handle Jira API flakiness, a practical use of Airflow’s robustness.

#### 4. Run and Test
- Start Airflow: `airflow webserver` and `airflow scheduler`.
- Trigger via UI: Watch tasks flow in `http://localhost:8080`.
- Check Slack: See the daily update.
- Simulate issues: Adjust thresholds or data to trigger the email.

---

### Why This Justifies Airflow
- **Orchestration**: Manages multiple steps (fetch, analyze, notify) with clear dependencies.
- **Automation**: Runs daily without manual intervention, saving engineers from repetitive checks.
- **Scalability**: Can grow to include more checks (e.g., cross-referencing GitHub PRs) or teams.
- **Reliability**: Retries failed tasks (e.g., Jira downtime) and logs issues in the UI.

### What You Will Learn
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Using `trigger_rule` for conditional escalation.
- **External Integrations**: Combining Jira, Slack, and email in one pipeline.
- **Proactive Value**: Automation that prevents sprint derailment, not just reports.


Let’s iterate on the Jira Sprint Health Monitor to incorporate a time-series database for logging data over time. This will allow us to track historical sprint metrics, detect patterns, and lay the groundwork for ML-driven insights—all while keeping it relatable for software engineers and justifying Airflow’s orchestration power.

---

### Revised Project Idea: Jira Sprint Health Monitor with Time-Series Storage

**Objective**: Enhance the pipeline to monitor sprint health, store key metrics and issue data in a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB), and still provide real-time alerts via Slack/email. The stored data will enable future ML use cases, like predicting sprint delays or identifying recurring blockers.

**Why This Is More Interesting**:
- **Historical Tracking**: Logs sprint data over time, revealing trends (e.g., velocity drop-offs, chronic stalling).
- **ML Readiness**: Time-series storage is perfect for feeding into models to predict outcomes or optimize sprints.
- **Future-Proof**: Engineers can build on this for analytics or automation without starting from scratch.
- **Airflow Fit**: Managing data extraction, storage, and notifications across systems is where Airflow excels.

### Project Breakdown

#### What the Pipeline Does
1. **Extract**: Fetch Jira sprint data (issues, statuses, story points, timestamps).
2. **Analyze**: Calculate sprint health metrics (velocity, stalled/overdue counts).
3. **Store**: Write metrics and issue details to a time-series database (InfluxDB).
4. **Act**: Post a Slack summary and escalate critical issues via email.

#### Why a Time-Series Database (InfluxDB)?
- **Time-Series Fit**: Sprint data (e.g., velocity, issue updates) is inherently temporal, and InfluxDB handles this efficiently.
- **Scalability**: Designed for high write/read performance, ideal for daily logs across multiple sprints.
- **ML Potential**: Easy to query for training models (e.g., predict velocity based on historical trends).
- **Visualization**: Pairs well with tools like Grafana for dashboards (a future bonus).

#### Tools and Prerequisites
- **Apache Airflow**: Local/server setup.
- **InfluxDB**: Open-source time-series DB (can run locally via Docker).
- **Python Libraries**: `jira`, `pandas`, `influxdb-client`, `slack_sdk`, `airflow.providers.smtp`.
- **Jira API Access**: Same as before.
- **Slack Webhook**: For notifications.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Set Up Environment
- **Install Airflow and Dependencies**: `pip install apache-airflow jira pandas influxdb-client slack_sdk airflow.providers.smtp`.
- **Set Up InfluxDB**:
  - Run via Docker: `docker run -d -p 8086:8086 influxdb:latest`.
  - Create a bucket (e.g., `sprint_data`) and get an API token from the InfluxDB UI (`http://localhost:8086`).
- **Configure Credentials**: Store Jira, Slack, and InfluxDB details (URL, token, org, bucket) in Airflow Variables.

#### 2. Write the DAG File
Create `jira_sprint_monitor_with_storage.py` in the `dags/` folder.

#### 3. Explanation of Changes
- **Storage Task**: Writes two types of data to InfluxDB:
  - **Sprint Metrics**: Velocity, stalled/overdue counts, tagged by sprint ID.
  - **Issue States**: Per-issue details (status, points, assignee) with timestamps for historical tracking.
- **Data Passing**: `analyze_sprint_health` now returns both summary and raw data for storage.
- **Time-Series Design**: Uses InfluxDB’s tags (e.g., `sprint_id`, `issue_key`) and fields (e.g., `velocity`) for efficient querying later.
- **Future-Proofing**: The schema supports ML (e.g., time-series forecasting of velocity) and dashboards.

#### 4. Run and Test
- Start Airflow and InfluxDB: `airflow webserver`, `airflow scheduler`, and Docker container.
- Trigger the DAG: Check the UI at `http://localhost:8080`.
- Verify Storage: Query InfluxDB (`SELECT * FROM sprint_metrics`) to see logged data.
- Check Slack/Email: Ensure notifications work.

---

### Why This Justifies Airflow and Adds Value
- **Complex Workflow**: Coordinates fetching, analyzing, storing, and notifying across systems—beyond a simple script’s scope.
- **Data Persistence**: Logs data for long-term insights, not just one-off reports.
- **ML Foundation**: Time-series data enables models to predict sprint completion or flag risky assignees.
- **Reliability**: Retries and monitoring ensure the pipeline keeps running.

### ML Use Cases Enabled
1. **Velocity Prediction**: Train a model on historical velocity to forecast sprint completion.
2. **Blocker Detection**: Identify patterns in stalled issues (e.g., specific assignees or issue types).
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Spot unusual drops in progress compared to past sprints.

### What Engineers Will Learn
- **Storage Integration**: Writing to a time-series DB with Airflow.
- **Scalable Design**: Structuring data for future analytics/ML.
- **Real Value**: Automation that not only alerts but builds a data asset.

This iteration makes the project more compelling—engineers see immediate utility (alerts) and long-term potential (ML-driven insights). The time-series DB adds a layer of sophistication that justifies Airflow’s orchestration while keeping it approachable. Does this feel like a step in the right direction?
