Let's build a Motorola 6800 (M6800) simulator in C#. We'll start with a minimal architecture and iterate.

The basic components we'll need:

* **Memory (64KB)**
* **CPU Registers**: A, B, X, PC, SP, CCR
* **Instruction decoder and executor**
* **Instruction set (partial to start)**

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Basic Structure and CPU Registers

```csharp
public class Cpu6800
{
    public byte A;         // Accumulator A
    public byte B;         // Accumulator B
    public ushort X;       // Index Register
    public ushort PC;      // Program Counter
    public byte SP;        // Stack Pointer
    public byte CCR;       // Condition Code Register (flags)

    public byte[] Memory = new byte[ushort.MaxValue + 1];

    public void Reset()
    {
        A = 0;
        B = 0;
        X = 0;
        PC = ReadWord(0xFFFE); // Reset Vector
        SP = 0xFF;
        CCR = 0x00;
    }

    public byte ReadByte(ushort addr) => Memory[addr];
    public void WriteByte(ushort addr, byte value) => Memory[addr] = value;
    public ushort ReadWord(ushort addr) => (ushort)((Memory[addr] << 8) | Memory[addr + 1]);
    public void WriteWord(ushort addr, ushort value)
    {
        Memory[addr] = (byte)(value >> 8);
        Memory[addr + 1] = (byte)(value & 0xFF);
    }
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Instruction Execution Skeleton

```csharp
public void Step()
{
    var opcode = ReadByte(PC++);
    switch (opcode)
    {
        case 0x86: // LDA Immediate
            A = ReadByte(PC++);
            break;
        case 0xB6: // LDA Absolute
            var addr = ReadWord(PC);
            PC += 2;
            A = ReadByte(addr);
            break;
        case 0x20: // BRA
            PC += (sbyte)ReadByte(PC++);
            break;
        default:
            throw new NotImplementedException($"Opcode {opcode:X2} not implemented.");
    }
}
```

Awesome goal. To hook young software engineers into the world of vintage CPUs like the 6800/68000, we need a scenario that:

* Has **visual/interactive feedback**
* Relates to **modern concepts** (like games, puzzles, or automation)
* Feels like they‚Äôre **controlling hardware**, like early embedded systems

---

### üéÆ Scenario: "Escape the Byte Dungeon"

**Story**:
You're inside a forgotten 8-bit machine, trapped in a dungeon built from memory addresses. To escape, you must write code to control a robot moving through the memory grid, collect keys (data bytes), and unlock the exit (a specific memory condition).

---

### üí° Core Mechanics

| Mechanic       | Implementation                         | 6800 Concepts Covered                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Memory-as-Map  | 256-byte memory block (16x16)          | Memory addressing, indirect access     |
| Robot Movement | Write direction codes to a port        | I/O simulation, memory-mapped I/O      |
| Read Sensors   | Use memory-mapped addresses for input  | Polling I/O, branch decisions          |
| Collect Key    | Check a specific byte in a memory cell | Data comparison, flags, branches       |
| Exit Condition | Match memory layout or flag to escape  | Program flow, loop, condition code use |

---

### üß† Learning Objectives

* Learn assembly control flow
* Understand memory layout as spatial structure
* Experience I/O via mapped memory
* Write tiny programs with constraints and purpose

---

### üõ† Implementation Plan

1. **C# Simulator Enhancements**

   * Add a `MemoryMap` for I/O (robot controls)
   * Add hooks for "rendering" (e.g., Console output of the robot in the grid)

2. **Robot API (6800 Assembly)**

   * Movement: `0xF0` memory address ‚Äî write `0x01=UP`, `0x02=DOWN`, `0x03=LEFT`, `0x04=RIGHT`
   * Sensor: `0xF1` ‚Äî returns `0x01` if key present at current location
   * Status: `0xF2` ‚Äî set to `0xFF` when goal reached

3. **Level Layout**

   * Map at `0x0100 - 0x01FF`, 16x16 grid
   * Key at `0x0156`, Exit at `0x01A3`
   * Player starts at `0x0110`

4. **Sample Assembly Program**

   * Move right ‚Üí check sensor ‚Üí collect key ‚Üí reach goal ‚Üí write `0xFF` to `0xF2`

---

### üåü Bonus

* Add **step-through** debug mode in C#
* Provide **visual output** of the map
* Include **instruction count limits** (teaches optimization)
* Offer **challenge levels**

Here are five more engaging and educational scenario ideas tailored for young software engineers exploring the 6800/68000 world for the first time:

---

### 1. üõ∞Ô∏è **Satellite Uplink Challenge**

**Story**:
You're controlling a vintage satellite‚Äôs onboard 6800 system. It needs to align its antenna toward Earth and send a transmission back before it drifts out of range.

**Mechanics**:

* Rotate antenna via memory-mapped commands
* Read signal strength from memory-mapped sensors
* Only send if alignment and power levels are correct
* Must complete in under 200 cycles

**Skills Learned**:

* Loops, conditional logic, memory-mapped I/O, cycle budgeting

### 2. üéµ **Chiptune Synthesizer**

**Story**:
Use the 6800 to create a looping melody. Each byte you write to a port triggers a note. You program the CPU like a primitive music sequencer.

**Mechanics**:

* Write note values to `0xF0` (sound port)
* Timing handled via loop counters
* Compose simple melodies (8-bit style)

**Skills Learned**:

* Loops, indexed addressing, timing control, delay loops

### 3. üïπÔ∏è **Simon Says Game Clone**

**Story**:
Recreate the classic memory game using memory-mapped buttons and LEDs. The system shows a pattern, the player must input it.

**Mechanics**:

* LEDs at `0xF0‚Äì0xF3` (output), buttons at `0xF4‚Äì0xF7` (input)
* Generate random pattern in memory
* Poll input and compare to expected sequence

**Skills Learned**:

* Bit manipulation, I/O handling, branching logic, random number (via counters)

---

### 4. üì¶ **Warehouse Sorting Bot**

**Story**:
A small autonomous robot must sort boxes in a 2D warehouse using sensors and an actuator. Each box has a type byte. You must move it to the correct slot.

**Mechanics**:

* Move via control port (`0xF0`)
* Read box type at current location
* Sort by writing to correct location

**Skills Learned**:

* Indexed memory access, control logic, sorting logic, memory map design

---

### 5. üîê **Codebreaker Terminal**

**Story**:
You've found a locked computer from the past. Its 6800 firmware requires cracking a 3-byte access code through brute-force and logic filters.

**Mechanics**:

* Enter code via memory
* Read result (success/fail) from memory-mapped status
* Optimize to solve in minimal cycles

**Skills Learned**:

* Loops, nested iteration, optimization, memory interaction, brute-force logic
