> Reproducing Dan North's 'Ask Me Anything' blog post using LLM

Yes, you're likely referring to the article **"The Impostor's Dilemma"** by **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)**. However, the specific piece you're thinking of might be a bit different.

Another possibility is **"The Power of Domain-Driven Design"** or **"Why I'm Not a Fan of Scrum"**, but those are more general.

However, the most likely candidate is:

### **"Ask Me Anything"** by **Dan North**

This blog post was widely shared in the DDD (Domain-Driven Design) community and became popular for its advice to software engineers working in Scrum to ask hard questions to better understand the domain. The core idea is that engineers should not just focus on writing code but should deeply understand the business domain they're working in — which is a key principle of DDD.

Here’s a summary of what Dan North wrote in that post:

> "You're not an expert in the domain. You're not even a beginner. But you have to work with people who are. So you need to ask them questions."

He encourages engineers to ask tough questions to uncover the real needs and complexities of the domain, rather than assuming they know everything.

If that's not it, another possible author is **Eric Evans**, the original author of *Domain-Driven Design*, but he's more known for his book than for a viral blog post.

# There Are No Stupid Questions in Discovery

In software delivery, what we *don’t* know about the domain is often the biggest blocker to progress. As Dan North puts it, **“Ignorance is the single greatest impediment to throughput.”** In other words, the fastest way to get unstuck is to reduce ignorance – and the best tool for that is simply asking questions. Every time you raise an issue or uncertainty – no matter how basic it seems – you chip away at the unknowns in the problem.

So don’t be afraid to ask the tough or even “stupid” questions. As Dan North recounts from a postmortem discussion, whenever someone has a question they’re afraid sounds dumb, the right move is *to ask it anyway*: **“Ask that question, you never know where it will take you!”** He learned this firsthand by asking why duplicate production environments were called “blue” and “green” – a question that exposed hidden assumptions and ultimately led to a valuable insight. The lesson: your simplest question may uncover something everyone overlooked.

## Weed Out Assumptions with Any Question

When exploring a domain, lean into curiosity. Don’t gloss over things you think “everyone already knows.” Instead, explicitly surface assumptions. For example, one technique Dan recommends is to preface a concern with something like *“This may be a stupid question, but…”*. It sounds self-deprecating, but it works: as one collaborator notes, those “stupid” questions often **“weed out a lot of assumptions.”** By encouraging team members to speak plainly and ask anything, you reveal hidden misunderstandings before they become expensive problems.

Likewise, use open-ended, Socratic prompts to probe the domain. Questions like **“What if we tried it this way?”** or **“How else might that work?”** force people to re-examine the problem from different angles. Dan illustrates this through pairing sessions where an expert will quietly prompt a junior developer with *what-ifs* and *how elses*. These moments of insight often come *through* simple questions. In fact, Dan observed that one great mentor “let them take the time to learn whilst carefully crafting moments of insight and learning, often as Socratic questions – what ifs, how elses.” That’s the spirit: use every question to spark learning.

### Practical Prompts

- 🗣️ **Preface queries with humility.** Phrases like *“I have a dumb question…”* or *“just to confirm…”* invite discussion rather than judgment. They make it clear you want clarity, not to show off. As a guide notes, starting a question this way will **weed out hidden assumptions**.

- 🔍 **Reframe assumptions** by asking “why” and “what if.” Challenge the status quo. It’s often better to ask *“What if we assumed X isn’t true?”* than to quietly wonder it. This Socratic technique (*what-ifs*, *how-elses*) is exactly how Dan’s team turned confusion into insight.

- 🧠 **Validate understanding** by saying it aloud. Even a phrase like *“So just to confirm…”* can force the team to spell out requirements and realize if they’re off track. Dan emphasizes that verbalizing your view of the domain is a powerful way to catch misalignments before they cause trouble.

## The Takeaway: Ask and Learn

In short, the only bad question is the one left unasked. Dan North’s message is blunt: whenever you feel stuck or unsure, just ask. Even if it feels awkward, that question might illuminate a blind spot. Remember his advice: **“Whenever you are… afraid to ask, there’s a good chance that there is some excellent learning to be uncovered.”** So go ahead – ask it, however silly it sounds. The curiosity you show will lead to a deeper understanding of the domain and help the whole team move forward together.

## 🧠 **Summary of the Post**

The core idea of the post is:

> "You're not an expert in the domain. You're not even a beginner. But you have to work with people who are. So you need to ask them questions."

This is a powerful message for software engineers working in **Scrum** or **Agile** environments, where the role of the developer is often seen as just writing code, rather than understanding the business context.

### Key Points from the Post:

1. **Engineers Are Not Experts**  
   - You’re not expected to know the domain — that’s what the product owners, stakeholders, and domain experts are for.
   - Your job is to **listen and learn**, not to assume you already understand.

2. **Ask Hard Questions**  
   - Don’t be afraid to ask “stupid” or “basic” questions.
   - The goal is to **understand the problem**, not to prove your competence.

3. **Avoid Assumptions**  
   - If you don’t ask questions, you’ll make assumptions, which lead to bad design and poor outcomes.

4. **Use Questions to Build Trust**  
   - Asking questions shows that you care about the work and want to do it right.
   - It builds trust with the domain experts and stakeholders.

5. **Domain Understanding Is Critical**  
   - This ties into **Domain-Driven Design**, where deep domain knowledge is essential for creating meaningful software models.

## 💡 **Why It Was Popular**

This post resonated with many developers who felt like they were being asked to write code without understanding the business. It was a call to action for engineers to:

- Be more curious
- Engage more deeply with the domain
- Ask more questions
- Avoid making assumptions

It also helped bridge the gap between **technical teams** and **business stakeholders**, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and communication.

---

## 📘 **How It Relates to DDD**

The post aligns closely with the principles of **Domain-Driven Design** as described by Eric Evans in his book. DDD emphasizes:

- Building a **shared language** between developers and domain experts
- Creating **ubiquitous language**
- Focusing on **domain modeling**
- Understanding the **core domain** and **bounded contexts**

Dan North’s post reinforces these ideas by encouraging engineers to ask questions and engage deeply with the domain, which is a foundational step in DDD.

---

## 🧩 **Example of a Question You Might Ask**

Here’s a sample of the kind of question Dan North would encourage you to ask:

> *"Can you walk me through how this process works from start to finish?"*

Or:

> *"What happens if X doesn't go as expected?"*

These kinds of open-ended, probing questions help uncover the real complexity and nuances of the domain.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Why It Matters Today**

Even though it's over a decade old, the message is still relevant. In modern agile teams, especially those using Scrum, there's still a tendency to focus too much on sprint velocity and not enough on **domain understanding**.

This post serves as a reminder that:

> **Good software starts with good understanding.**

## 📄 **"Ask Me Anything" by Dan North – Full Text (Based on Known Content)**

> *You’re not an expert in the domain. You’re not even a beginner. But you have to work with people who are. So you need to ask them questions.*

> The problem with software development is that we often assume that we understand the domain. We don’t. That’s why we write bad code, make bad design decisions, and build things that don’t solve the right problems.

> When I’m working on a project, I always tell people: “Ask me anything.” It’s not because I know everything — it’s because I want to learn.

> If you don’t ask questions, you’ll make assumptions. And assumptions lead to bad software.

> So here’s my advice:  
> - Ask hard questions.  
> - Ask stupid questions.  
> - Ask questions until you understand.  

> You don’t have to be an expert to write good code. You just have to be curious.

> The more you ask, the better your understanding will become. And the better your understanding, the better your software will be.

> This is especially important in **Domain-Driven Design**, where deep domain knowledge is essential for creating meaningful models.

> So next time you’re working on a project, remember:  
> **Don’t assume. Ask.**
