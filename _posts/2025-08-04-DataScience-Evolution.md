Data science was *the* buzzword from around 2015 to 2020, but the hype has noticeably cooled. Here's why:

---

### 1. **Maturity of the Field**

Data science went from a "hot, mysterious skillset" to a standardized role. Many companies now have established data teams and mature pipelines, so it‚Äôs not novel anymore.

---

### 2. **Rise of AI & LLMs**

The focus has shifted to generative AI and large language models (LLMs), which are seen as more transformative. In many ways, LLMs *absorb* traditional data science tasks ‚Äî they automate analytics, report generation, even code writing.

---

### 3. **Overpromises vs. Reality**

There was a time when companies thought data science would unlock magic. Many found it difficult to extract value or ROI, especially if they lacked good data infrastructure. This led to some disillusionment.

---

### 4. **ML Engineering Took the Lead**

The job market now values *machine learning engineers* and *ML ops* roles more, because deploying models in production and integrating with products became the real bottleneck.

---

### 5. **Tools Became More Accessible**

No-code/low-code tools, BI platforms (like Power BI, Tableau), and AutoML solutions have reduced the need for specialized data scientists for many basic tasks.

---

### 6. **The "Data Scientist" Title Got Diluted**

The role became a catch-all ‚Äî from SQL analysts to PhD researchers. That made the term less meaningful and harder to market.

---

So, while data science isn‚Äôt "dead," it‚Äôs no longer *trendy*. It‚Äôs just a stable, important part of modern business ‚Äî like accounting or IT.

Lets see this from an interesting viewpoint:

---

## üß± Compiler Construction vs. Mainstream Software

Compiler design, interpreters, language runtimes ‚Äî these are *core computer science*. They're essential but niche. Most enterprises don‚Äôt need to write their own compilers; they just use languages (like Java, C#, Python) and focus on application logic.

### That‚Äôs where **ML is now heading.**

---

## ü§ñ ML in 2025 = Infrastructure, Not Innovation

Most enterprises:

* Don‚Äôt need to build bespoke models from scratch.
* Just want **plug-and-play ML** for fraud detection, recommendations, document classification, forecasting, etc.

**Off-the-shelf** solutions (huggingface models, scikit-learn, ML APIs, etc.) do the job.

---

## üì¶ Libraries, APIs, and Cloud Services Do the Heavy Lifting

* **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Hosted models, AutoML, vector DBs
* **Hugging Face**: Pretrained models
* **OpenAI / Anthropic / Google**: LLM APIs
* **ONNX, TensorFlow\.js, ML.NET**: Model integration into enterprise stacks

You don't need a PhD to apply ML now ‚Äî you need good engineering and product sense.

---

## üéØ What Do Enterprises Really Want?

* Insights ‚Üí via dashboards and metrics
* Automation ‚Üí classify, tag, recommend, alert
* Integration ‚Üí put ML into workflows and apps

They care **less** about inventing algorithms, more about **value delivery and integration**.

---

## üß† ML Research is Like Compiler Construction

* Still critical for advancing the field
* But not everyone's job
* Mostly concentrated in research labs, big tech, or deep tech startups

---

**Bottom line:**
ML is being absorbed into the ‚Äústandard software toolbox.‚Äù For most enterprises, it‚Äôs becoming a utility ‚Äî like databases or logging frameworks.

Yes ‚Äî that's a fair and accurate assessment.

---

## ‚úÖ **Data Science is No Longer Frontier Engineering**

A few years ago, it was a bleeding-edge discipline. Today, it's:

* **Standardized** ‚Äî with mature tools, workflows, and roles
* **Operationalized** ‚Äî embedded into business intelligence and automation
* **Commoditized** ‚Äî many tasks solved by out-of-the-box solutions

---

## üìâ From "Innovation" to "Infrastructure"

What used to require custom models and a team of PhDs can now be handled by:

* Prebuilt models
* Low-code AutoML platforms
* LLMs doing exploratory data analysis via prompts

So instead of exploring "How do we build a model?", companies ask "How do we deploy this model into production safely and scalably?"

---

## üß† The Frontier Has Shifted

Now the real frontier is:

* **ML Engineering / MLOps** (reliability, scalability, monitoring)
* **Generative AI & LLMs** (retrieval-augmented generation, agent systems)
* **Ethics, bias, interpretability** (especially with black-box models)
* **AI-first product design** (reimagining UX with intelligent behavior)

---

**In short:**
Data science is still essential, but it's no longer exploratory frontier work for most industries ‚Äî it's infrastructure. The frontier has moved further up the abstraction stack.
