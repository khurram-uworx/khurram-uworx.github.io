AI is everywhere‚Äîbut how much of what you hear is real, and how much is just hype? In this post, we cut through the buzzwords to explore what AI can actually do today. Get ready for a grounded look at the promises, pitfalls, and possibilities of artificial intelligence.

## üß† AI POC & Project Failure Rates

* **42%** of companies are **abandoning most AI initiatives** in 2025, up sharply from **17%** in 2024, per S\&P Global Market Intelligence. On average, **46% of AI POCs** are dropped before production ([[zebra.com](https://www.zebra.com/ap/en/blog/posts/2023/what-a-mobile-device-will-really-cost-your-organization.html)][1]).
* **88%** of AI pilots **never reach production**‚Äîonly about 1-in-8 are deployed, according to IDC/LENOVO .
* **70‚Äì90% POC failure rates** are reported by Gartner and others for custom-built AI, vendor-built AI POCs struggle too .
* Gartner predicts **‚â•30% of GenAI projects** will be **abandoned after PoC** by end of 2025 .
  ‚û°Ô∏è **Bottom line:** AI POCs regularly fail at rates between **40‚Äì90%**, depending on definitions (abandoned mid-project vs never entering production).

## üåê Previous Waves: Internet, Mobile, Cloud

### Internet Era & Dot‚Äëcom Boom

* The **dot‚Äëcom crash (2000‚Äì2002)** wiped out a majority of internet startups. Some estimates suggest **70‚Äì80% of dot‚Äëcoms failed**, but survivors laid the groundwork for modern tech ([[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)][2]).
* Classic projects like **CRMs** had failure rates as high as **70% in early 2000s**, later dropping to **\~40% by 2003** .

### Mobile & IoT

* IoT suffered **70‚Äì75% of deployments stuck at pilot stage**, unable to scale ([[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)][3]).
* Mobile hardware saw nearly **50% device failure** by year 4 (cracked screens, etc.) .
* Many early mobile tech launches (e.g., Google Glass, Microsoft Kin) were commercial failures‚Äîthough exact PoC failure rates are hard to find .

### Cloud

* In 2023, **69%** of enterprises experienced **cloud budget overruns**, with **60%** citing cost constraints, **41%** facing application optimization challenges, **38%** struggling with migrated app performance, and **34%** lacking trained staff ([[amzur.com](https://amzur.com/blog/why-cloud-computing-adoption-fails)][4]).
* No specific POC failure % for cloud, but **misconfigurations cause 99% of security incidents**‚Äîindicative of implementation risks ([[amzur.com](https://amzur.com/blog/why-cloud-computing-adoption-fails)][4]).

## üìä Comparison Summary

| Wave               | Reported Failure / Abandonment                                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Early Internet** | \~70‚Äì80% of startups failed; CRM POCs \~70% ‚Üí \~40% over time                          |
| **Mobile/IoT**     | 70‚Äì75% IoT stuck in pilot; mobile hardware \~50% fail by Y4                            |
| **Cloud**          | High implementation issues (cost, performance), but less clear % for POC failures      |
| **AI/GenAI**       | 40‚Äì90% POCs don‚Äôt go live; \~42% AI initiatives scrapped; 30% GenAI abandoned mid-2025 |

## ‚úÖ Insights & Takeaways

* **Every major tech wave** begins with high experimentation, broad hype, and **high failure/discard rates**‚Äîoften 40‚Äì80%.
* **AI‚Äôs 40‚Äì90% POC failure** is **normal**, especially given its complexity: messy data, immature infrastructure, unclear outcomes.
* As with internet/mobile/cloud, failure rates tend to **decline over time** as best practices, tooling, and maturity increase.
* **Failures are part of innovation**, not a sign of collapse‚Äîlearning from them builds future success.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why so many AI POCs fail

1. **Unclear value proposition or objectives**
2. **Poor data readiness** (quality, integration, privacy issues)
3. **Wall‚Äëstreet pressure & hype**‚Äîleading to rushed or under-resourced trials ([[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)][3])
4. **Lack of measurement tools** for tracking success&#x20;
5. **Compounding error rates** in multi-step AI flows (20% error per step leads to 63% total failure by 100 steps) ([[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECRM)][5])

### ‚úîÔ∏è Bottom Line

* **Yes**, AI POC failures (\~40‚Äì90%) are currently high‚Äîbut **not unexpected**, given similar disruption in past tech revolutions.
* **Over time**, failure declines as understanding, standards, data quality, tooling, and domain readiness improve‚Äîjust as it did with internet, mobile, and cloud.

The tech industry often experiences waves of hype cycles. Each of these domains you mentioned‚Äîmobile apps, blockchain, IoT, data science, and generative AI‚Äîcame with legitimate potential, but the market often overestimates short-term returns while underestimating the long-term impact.

**Here's why that happens:**

1. **Speculative Investment Culture:** Venture capital tends to chase trends. This inflates expectations and fuels the creation of countless startups, many of which lack solid business models or meaningful differentiation.

2. **Misaligned Incentives:** Media, influencers, and tech evangelists often amplify the hype to drive engagement, investments, or personal branding, regardless of maturity or scalability.

3. **Corporate FOMO:** Enterprises jump on trends to avoid appearing outdated, sometimes without a clear plan for integration or sustainability.

4. **Skill Shortages and Misapplication:** The talent gap can lead to poorly implemented solutions. For example, applying blockchain where a database would do or using generative AI without understanding its limitations.

Despite this, over time, the core technologies often settle into valuable niches. Think of how mobile matured into a staple or how data science is now embedded in business intelligence rather than standalone hype.

The key difference with **generative AI** is that it's infiltrating productivity tools, consumer applications, and software development itself‚Äîgiving it broader and potentially more enduring reach. But even here, we‚Äôre seeing inflated RoI expectations and underwhelming deployments in many enterprises.

So yes, real value exists‚Äîbut it's often drowned in noise.
