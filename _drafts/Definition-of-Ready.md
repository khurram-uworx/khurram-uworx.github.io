Including testing scenarios in a ticket's Definition of Ready (DoR) is **highly important** for ensuring quality, clarity, and efficiency in the development process. Here's why:

1. **Clarity and Alignment**: Testing scenarios define the expected behavior and acceptance criteria, ensuring developers, testers, and stakeholders share a clear understanding of what "done" means. This reduces ambiguity and miscommunication.

2. **Quality Assurance**: Well-defined testing scenarios help identify edge cases, functional requirements, and potential defects early, enabling proactive quality checks during development rather than reactive fixes later.

3. **Efficiency**: Including testing scenarios in the DoR allows testers to prepare test cases in parallel with development, streamlining the testing phase and reducing delays. It also helps developers code with testability in mind.

4. **Risk Mitigation**: Testing scenarios highlight critical use cases and potential failure points, reducing the risk of overlooking key functionality or delivering a product with undetected issues.

5. **Accountability**: A DoR with testing scenarios holds the team accountable for delivering a ticket that meets verifiable standards, fostering a culture of quality and thoroughness.

### Considerations:
- Testing scenarios should be specific, measurable, and relevant to the ticketâ€™s scope.
- They should cover functional, non-functional, and edge-case requirements.
- Overloading tickets with excessive scenarios can slow down progress, so balance is key.

In Agile or Scrum, including testing scenarios in the DoR is a best practice to ensure the ticket is "ready" for development and testing, ultimately leading to a smoother sprint and higher-quality deliverables.
