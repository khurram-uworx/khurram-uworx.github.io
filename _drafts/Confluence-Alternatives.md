## Microsoft 365

In Microsoft 365, the closest alternative to Confluence for documentation and knowledge management is **Microsoft OneNote** and **SharePoint**, often used together:

### âœ… Primary Tools:

1. **SharePoint Online**

   * Best equivalent to Confluence.
   * Used to create internal sites, wikis, document libraries.
   * Supports versioning, permissions, page templates, and structured navigation.
   * Integrates with Teams, OneDrive, Word, Excel, PowerPoint.

2. **OneNote**

   * Good for team notes, less structured than Confluence.
   * Not ideal for large-scale documentation but great for collaborative notetaking and quick knowledge sharing.

### ðŸ§© Optional Enhancements:

* **Microsoft Teams**
  Combine Teams + SharePoint to organize pages, docs, and conversations in one place.
* **Loop (Preview/Gradual Rollout)**
  Newer tool for modular documentation â€” think Notion-style blocks, still maturing.

---

### Suggested Setup for Engineering Team:

* Use **SharePoint Site** as your documentation hub.
* Create libraries for:

  * Processes
  * Onboarding
  * Architecture
  * Meeting Notes (linked from OneNote)
* Connect SharePoint to **Microsoft Teams** for day-to-day access.
* Enable versioning and approvals in SharePoint for documentation quality control.

You're not wrong â€” SharePointâ€™s Wiki and modern pages still feel clunky and outdated compared to Coda or even Confluence. But within the **M365 ecosystem**, there are a few tools you *can* consider as a sort of alternative, depending on your use case:

---

### âœ… **Microsoft Loop** â€“ *Closest to a modern, flexible workspace*

* **Pros**:

  * Real-time collaborative blocks (Loop components) that can be embedded in Teams, Outlook, and Word.
  * Supports rich content blocks like tables, checklists, task lists.
  * Syncs across Microsoft apps.
* **Cons**:

  * Still early days â€“ not fully mature yet.
  * No deep integration with external (non-Microsoft) systems yet.
* **Use case**: Collaborative docs and meeting notes with live components, basic workflows.

---

### âœ… **OneNote** â€“ *Good for internal wiki-style content*

* **Pros**:

  * Easy to use, widely adopted across orgs.
  * Integrates with Teams and Outlook well.
* **Cons**:

  * No real structure for pages beyond notebooks/sections.
  * No API or automation potential like Confluence or Coda.
* **Use case**: Lightweight team knowledge bases, personal or shared documentation.

---

### âœ… **Teams + SharePoint Modern Pages** â€“ *Structured, but limited*

* **Pros**:

  * Built-in with M365, already connected to Teams.
  * SharePoint pages can be modernized with web parts and embedded content.
* **Cons**:

  * Authoring experience is still rigid.
  * Poor versioning and navigation UX compared to modern tools.
* **Use case**: Static documentation, internal sites, policies.

---

### âœ… **Planner / Lists / Power Platform** â€“ *For workflow-heavy needs*

* **Microsoft Lists**: Structured data and light project tracking.
* **Power Automate**: Basic automation, like reminders or approvals.
* **Power Apps**: Build internal tools, but steep curve for non-devs.

---

### Recommendation:

If you're looking to replicate **Confluenceâ€™s wiki + workflow style**, your best option within M365 today is:

> **Loop for collaboration + SharePoint Modern Pages for structured docs + Microsoft Lists/Power Automate for workflows**

It wonâ€™t match the fluidity or integration power of Coda, but it can get the job done with decent usability *if* you combine these tools well. If adoption and friction are concerns, Loop is the one to watch closely.

## Coda

You're absolutely right â€” Coda has positioned itself as a highly flexible and extensible SaaS platform. Its strengths over Confluence often come down to:

* **Deep API & Packs system**: You can connect Coda to third-party tools (like Gmail, Slack, GitHub, etc.) with ease, and even build your own Packs, allowing two-way data sync â€” something Confluence lacks outside the Atlassian suite.
* **Document as an App**: Coda treats docs like lightweight apps, complete with buttons, automation, and structured data, while Confluence stays closer to a wiki model.
* **Custom Workflows**: Coda gives teams more freedom to create custom workflows and UI logic without being boxed into a rigid layout or plugin model.
* **Better for non-dev teams**: Itâ€™s often easier for non-technical teams to build powerful docs and integrations without help from admins or plugins.

Confluence still has its strengths â€” especially in large enterprise environments where Jira, Bitbucket, and Opsgenie are already in play â€” but Coda is definitely more future-forward for integration-rich and collaborative workspaces.
