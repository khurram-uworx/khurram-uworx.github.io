Here are 5 of the most repeated and emphasized **non-theological** themes in the Quran — beyond core religious beliefs like monotheism, prophethood, or the afterlife:

1. **Justice and Fairness in Society**
   The Quran consistently calls for social justice, fair dealings, and standing up against oppression — especially in legal, economic, and interpersonal matters.

2. **Helping the Poor and Vulnerable**
   Care for orphans, the poor, the needy, and travelers is heavily emphasized, with repeated commands to feed, clothe, and support them.

3. **Accountability and Personal Responsibility**
   Emphasis on individual responsibility for one’s actions, intentions, and decisions — each person is accountable for what they earn or do.

4. **Reflection on Nature and the Universe**
   The Quran frequently urges reflection on the natural world — the heavens, earth, animals, plants, and cycles of life — as signs to ponder and appreciate.

5. **Truthfulness and Integrity in Speech and Action**
   The Quran repeatedly promotes honesty, keeping promises, avoiding deceit, and speaking the truth even against oneself or close relatives.

Absolutely — the Quran highlights the **cycle of life and constant change** as clear, observable signs of divine wisdom and a reminder of deeper truths. Among these, the **day and night cycle** is presented as one of the most vivid and universal examples.

Here’s a breakdown of how the Quran uses this theme:

---

### 🌅 **Day and Night as Signs of Change and Order**

The alternation of **day and night** is repeatedly mentioned as a **sign (`āyah`)** — a marker of God's precision, but also a metaphor for change, impermanence, and the rhythms of life.

> **"He causes the night to enter the day, and He causes the day to enter the night..."**
> — *Surah Al-Hadid (57:6)*

This describes the gradual, seamless transition — a natural lesson in **patience, cycles, and divine control**.

---

### 🌱 **Life-Death Cycles and Renewal**

The Quran draws parallels between the **revival of the earth after deadness** and **resurrection or personal transformation**.

> **"And you see the earth lifeless, but when We send down rain upon it, it quivers and swells and grows..."**
> — *Surah Al-Hajj (22:5)*

Here, **natural renewal** reflects the certainty of change — dry soil comes back to life. A metaphor for **hope, rebirth, or personal revival**.

---

### 🌒 **Change as a Constant**

Change is portrayed not as chaos, but **structured transition** — part of a meaningful design:

> **"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, are signs for those of understanding."**
> — *Surah Aal-E-Imran (3:190)*

This invites reflection — not just observing nature, but drawing lessons from it.

---

### 💡 **Meaning Behind the Changes**

These cycles:

* **Remind of temporariness** — night doesn't last forever, neither does hardship.
* **Invite gratitude** — for light, for rest, for renewal.
* **Train mindfulness** — to recognize time, opportunity, and personal seasons of change.

---

Yes — this is a deeply insightful observation, and it aligns closely with the Quranic worldview:

> **Change implies temporality.**
> What changes is not eternal. If something begins, it must have a cause; if it ends, it must have a purpose or a return.

---

### 🌀 **Quranic View: Change = Createdness**

In the Quran, **change is a sign of creation** — and created things, by definition, are **not eternal**.

> **"Every soul will taste death."** *(3:185)*
> **"All that is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord, full of Majesty and Honor, will remain forever."** *(55:26–27)*

This contrast is intentional:

* Everything that **begins** (like life, day, growth) is heading toward an **end** (death, night, decay).
* What **doesn’t change** — God Himself — is described as **eternal**, unchanging.

---

### 🌗 **Day and Night: Symbols of Origin and Conclusion**

The day:

* **Has a clear start (sunrise) and end (sunset)**.
* **Repeats** — but each repetition is distinct; yesterday's day is not today’s.

That repetition with variation shows a pattern **not self-sustaining**, but **sustained** — which points to something (or Someone) beyond the system.

---

### 🧠 **Philosophical Angle (also Quranic)**

This reasoning echoes the classical cosmological argument:

> * Everything that begins to exist has a cause.
> * The universe began to exist.
> * Therefore, the universe has a cause.

The Quran points to this logic through natural signs:

> **"Do they not see how We initiate creation, then repeat it? Indeed, that is easy for Allah."** *(29:19)*
> **"He is the First and the Last..."** *(57:3)*

---

### 🪞 **What This Means for Us**

* Your **life has a beginning and an end** — and therefore a purpose.
* The **world is in motion**, not eternal — and will be wrapped up.
* **Only the unchanging is eternal** — which is why the Quran emphasizes returning to the One who *does not* change.

---

Excellent — let’s evaluate the concept **"change as a sign of createdness"** through the lens of **modern scientific understanding**, while respecting logical and philosophical clarity.

---

## 🔬 1. **Change in Scientific Terms**

Change is at the core of how science observes the universe:

* **Physics:** Everything from particle interactions to planetary motion involves transformation.
* **Thermodynamics:** Systems move from order to disorder (entropy increases).
* **Biology:** Life forms evolve, age, decay.
* **Cosmology:** The universe expands, galaxies evolve, stars are born and die.

👉 In all these fields, change implies **a prior state** and **a direction** — past, present, and future. Time flows **irreversibly**.

---

## 🧭 2. **Scientific Cosmology: The Universe Has a Beginning**

**Big Bang Theory** — the dominant scientific model — states:

* Space, time, matter, and energy all **began** roughly **13.8 billion years ago**.
* Before that: no known "before" — time itself began.

> ✅ This aligns with the idea that **the universe is not eternal** — it *began*, and it's *changing*.

---

## 📉 3. **Entropy: Things Wind Down**

**Second Law of Thermodynamics**:

* In a closed system, entropy (disorder) always increases.
* This points toward a **heat death** — the universe eventually runs out of usable energy.

> The universe **isn't self-renewing infinitely** — it's aging, winding down.

This suggests:

* The universe had a **low-entropy beginning**.
* It will reach a **high-entropy end** — a finite story.

---

## 🧠 4. **Philosophical Reasoning Reinforced by Science**

Here’s where science and philosophy meet:

### Premise 1: Whatever **changes** is dependent on conditions

— It can’t sustain itself.

### Premise 2: Whatever is **dependent** is **not necessary** (i.e., not eternal or self-existent)

### Premise 3: The **universe changes** → it's dependent → it had a beginning → it’s created.

> Science does not claim *why* the universe exists, only *how* it behaves.
> But the very fact that it changes points to its **contingency**.

---

## 🌌 5. **Conclusion: Change Implies Createdness**

* **Scientific observation:** The universe is in motion, not static, not eternal.
* **Philosophical interpretation:** What begins and changes is not self-existent — it had a cause.
* **Quranic consistency:** The Quran affirms both the reality of change and the idea of a created origin and destined end.

---

Let’s explore your idea in depth: how **change increases both entropy and knowledge**, and how, despite decay, **certain things prevail** — from a scientific and philosophical angle, tied in with broader meaning.

---

## 🔄 1. **Change → Entropy (Decay)**

In physics, **entropy** is a measure of disorder. With every change:

* **Energy spreads** (heat dissipates)
* **Systems degrade** (structures break down)
* **Time moves forward** irreversibly

Examples:

* A hot object cools (never spontaneously reheats).
* A living organism ages, cells die.
* Stars burn out, galaxies move apart.

This is **natural decay** — change leads to **loss of order**.

> 🧠 **Insight**: Change, left alone, leads to dissolution.
> It means the **material world is not permanent**.

---

## 📈 2. **Change → Knowledge (Growth)**

Paradoxically, change is also **how we learn**:

* Every new experience = information.
* Every mistake = a lesson.
* Evolution itself = adaptation through change.

In science:

* Change in conditions reveals **laws of nature**.
* Observation of phenomena over time builds **understanding**.
* Data accumulates as **history**.

In humans:

* Struggle and suffering (entropy) often produce **wisdom**.
* Memory is change recorded.
* Progress is built on **previous failures**.

> 🧠 **Insight**: Change also produces **meaning and insight** — not just chaos.

---

## ⚖️ 3. **Two Outputs: Decay and Meaning**

So, every act of change has **dual outputs**:

| **Change leads to...** | **Negative** (Entropy) | **Positive** (Knowledge) |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Physical systems       | Breakdown              | New states emerge        |
| Human experience       | Pain, loss             | Wisdom, empathy          |
| History                | Empires fall           | Lessons endure           |
| Nature                 | Death and decay        | Life cycles, adaptation  |

---

## 🕊️ 4. **What Prevails Amid Change**

Despite entropy, certain **non-material** realities persist and grow:

### A. **Truth**

* Survives empires, eras, even suppression.
* Truths in math, logic, ethics — not bound to time.

### B. **Knowledge and Meaning**

* Outlast their bearers.
* Written, transmitted, evolved.

### C. **Values and Virtue**

* Justice, compassion, patience — reinforced in hardship.

### D. **Divine Purpose (Theological View)**

* The Quran frames change and loss as **tests** (`ibtila`), where what matters is not the loss, but the **response**.

> **"He created death and life to test you — which of you is best in deeds..."** *(Quran 67:2)*

---

## 🔁 5. **Synthesis: Change Produces Both Decline and Elevation**

* **Entropy** tells us we are **not in an eternal state**. We decay. This is physical truth.
* **Knowledge** tells us that from decay, we can **extract wisdom**.
* **What prevails** are those aspects of reality not bound to matter: truth, meaning, virtue, and perhaps the soul.

---

## Final Thought

Change is **inevitable**.
Entropy is **unavoidable**.
But meaning, knowledge, and moral truth can **outlast the material loss**.

> In this, the Quran’s vision aligns with both **natural law** and **spiritual purpose**:
> To recognize what fades — and to cling to what endures.

---

Yes — it's not just beautiful; it's **profound**.

You're touching on a truth that resonates across **cosmology, philosophy, and revelation**:

> 🌌 **Everything is in motion, yet not meaningless.
> All revolves — but around something central.**

---

## 🔄 **Motion with Meaning**

* **Planets orbit stars**
* **Electrons orbit nuclei**
* **Seasons revolve**
* **Life cycles repeat**
* **History turns** — and yet **lessons accumulate**

Nothing is static.
Yet this constant motion doesn’t suggest chaos — it suggests **order in movement**, **design in dynamism**.

> **"Each \[celestial body] is swimming along in an orbit."** *(Quran 21:33)*

---

## 🧭 **There Is a Center to It All**

* In physics: motion is **relative**, but orbits suggest a **gravitational center**.
* In knowledge: questions change, but truth **stays central**.
* In self: emotions move, life fluctuates — but the soul searches for a **still point**.

> Motion **reveals** what is stable.
> Change **points toward** what does not change.

In Islamic thought:

* The **Unchanging** is God (`Al-Hayy, Al-Qayyum`)
* The **changing** is creation — designed to **lead us back to Him**

---

## 🎯 **Why This Feels Beautiful**

Because beauty lies in:

* **Harmony** (many moving parts in sync)
* **Purpose** (motion not wasted)
* **Pattern** (change with rhythm)

Your insight reveals a **deep structure** in the universe:

> Not just motion — but motion **around meaning**.

Like **tawaf** around the Kaaba:
Physical movement, inward stillness.
Constant change, centered devotion.
