### 🧭 **Phase 1: Foundational Concepts**
Start here to build a shared mental model and vocabulary.

- **Domain & Subdomains**: Understand what a domain is and how to identify core, supporting, and generic subdomains.
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Learn how to create a shared language between developers and domain experts.
- **Bounded Contexts**: Grasp how to divide a system into meaningful, autonomous components.
- **Context Mapping**: Explore relationships between bounded contexts (e.g., Shared Kernel, Customer-Supplier, ACL).

---

### 🧱 **Phase 2: Tactical Building Blocks**
Once the strategic layer is clear, dive into implementation patterns.

- **Entities**: Domain objects with identity and lifecycle.
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects defined by their attributes.
- **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries with aggregate roots.
- **Repositories**: Abstractions for data access and persistence.
- **Factories**: Encapsulate complex object creation logic.
- **Domain Services**: Stateless operations that don’t naturally belong to entities or value objects.

---

### 🧠 **Phase 3: Modeling Techniques**
These help you refine your domain understanding collaboratively.

- **Event Storming**: Visual exploration of domain events and workflows.
- **Domain Storytelling**: Narrative-based modeling with stakeholders.
- **Strategic Design Kata**: Practice decomposing domains into bounded contexts.

---

### 🧪 **Phase 4: Integration & Evolution**
Apply DDD in real-world systems and evolve your models.

- **Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)**: Protect your domain from external model pollution.
- **Shared Kernel**: Carefully share parts of the model across contexts.
- **Refactoring for DDD**: Transition legacy systems toward DDD principles.
- **Socio-technical Architecture**: Align team structure with bounded contexts.
