* **Backend (Internal Use):**

  * Power Apps: List/sort candidates, view status, feedback, etc.
  * SharePoint/Dataverse: Store data, resumes, metadata.

* **Automation:**

  * Power Automate: Notifications, reminders, scoring logic, scheduling interviews.

* **Collaboration:**

  * Teams channel per role or candidate stage.
  * Adaptive Cards to review/respond directly from Teams.

---

### üöÄ Suggestion: Build Phase-Wise

1. **MVP:**

   * Inbound application capture (web + LinkedIn via email).
   * SharePoint list + Power Apps frontend.
   * Teams notifications.

2. **Phase 2:**

   * Scoring system + filters.
   * Interview scheduling.

3. **Phase 3:**

   * Resume parsing (AI Builder or Azure).
   * Power BI dashboard.
   * Candidate feedback collection.

---

Absolutely. Here's a **step-by-step guide** to walk you through how a candidate can apply via your **static HTML website**, upload a resume, and how you can pull that into **Power Automate** for processing.

---

## üß© Objective

From your **HTML form**, capture:

* Candidate data (e.g., name, email, message)
* Resume upload (PDF/doc)
  And bring this into your internal Microsoft environment using **Power Automate**.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Guide

### **Step 1: Handle Form Submission with File Upload**

Since your site is static, use a **backend form handler**. Two options:

#### Option A: Use Microsoft Forms (Easiest)

* Embed a **Microsoft Form** in your website (`<iframe>` or hyperlink).
* It supports file uploads (stores to OneDrive).
* Power Automate has native triggers for MS Forms.

> üí° Fastest way to integrate without backend code.

#### Option B: Use Formspree / Web3Forms / Your Own API (More Control)

* Use a service like [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) or create a **small serverless function** (Azure Function or Firebase).
* Make form submit to this endpoint.
* Upload file to **OneDrive or Azure Blob** from there.

---

### **Step 2: Trigger Power Automate**

Depending on the option above:

#### üîπ If using Microsoft Forms

1. Create a Form:

   * Add fields (Name, Email, etc.)
   * Enable **file upload** (OneDrive)
2. In **Power Automate**:

   * Trigger: ‚Äú**When a new response is submitted**‚Äù (Microsoft Forms)
   * Actions:

     * Get response details
     * Get file from OneDrive
     * Save candidate info to SharePoint / Dataverse
     * Send notification to Teams or email

#### üîπ If using Custom Endpoint (e.g., with Azure)

1. In form handler (e.g., Azure Function), after file upload:

   * Send an HTTP request to a Power Automate **HTTP-triggered flow**.
2. In **Power Automate**:

   * Trigger: ‚Äú**When an HTTP request is received**‚Äù
   * Parse JSON (name, email, resume URL)
   * Save info to SharePoint
   * Download file to your internal storage (e.g., SharePoint or OneDrive)
   * Notify via Teams/email

---

## üóÇ Suggested SharePoint Schema (for candidate data)

Create a SharePoint List:

| Column Name     | Type           |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| FullName        | Text           |
| Email           | Text           |
| Phone           | Text           |
| PositionApplied | Choice/Text    |
| ResumeLink      | Hyperlink      |
| SubmissionDate  | DateTime       |
| Notes/Tags      | Text/Multiline |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Bonus: Embed in Website

You can embed a Microsoft Form like this:

```html
<iframe src="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=..." width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

Or link directly to it from an **‚ÄúApply Now‚Äù** button.

---

## üöÄ What's Next?

Once this flow is working, your devs can build:

* A **Power Apps frontend** to view, filter, and rate applicants.
* Auto-tagging resumes with Power Automate + AI Builder.

---

Would you like:

* A sample Microsoft Form?
* A ready-to-import Power Automate flow?
* Or help building a lightweight backend to receive form submissions and upload to OneDrive?

You're absolutely right ‚Äî **Microsoft Forms does not support public file uploads** (only internal users), so it's not viable for external candidates.
‚úÖ Going with an **Azure Function** is the correct direction ‚Äî and yes, it **can fully handle file uploads and form data**, making it a flexible and powerful backend for your static website's ‚ÄúApply Now‚Äù form.

---

## ‚úÖ What Azure Function Can Do for You

1. **Receive multipart/form-data** POST requests (file + fields).
2. **Extract and save the resume** (e.g., to Azure Blob Storage or OneDrive via Graph API).
3. **Store form fields + file reference** as structured JSON (e.g., write to Azure Table, Cosmos DB, or send to Power Automate).
4. **Trigger downstream workflows** in Power Automate, Dataverse, or SharePoint.

---

## üß© How It Will Work

### 1. **HTML Form (Static Site)**

```html
<form action="https://your-function.azurewebsites.net/api/ApplyNow" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="text" name="fullName" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" required />
  <input type="file" name="resume" accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx" required />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Apply Now</button>
</form>
```

### 2. **Azure Function (C# or Node.js)**

Handles:

* Reading the form fields (text inputs)
* Parsing and saving the file (resume)
* Returning a success response or triggering Power Automate

You can save the resume file:

* To **Azure Blob Storage** (best for scale)
* Or send directly to Power Automate via webhook or Microsoft Graph

---

## ‚úÖ Example Use Cases After Upload

* Trigger a **Power Automate** flow using HTTP/Webhook.
* Save candidate info in **SharePoint** list or **Dataverse**.
* Send a **notification in Teams**.
* Auto-email confirmation to the candidate.

---

## üí° Architecture Summary

```plaintext
[Website HTML Form] ‚Üí [Azure Function] ‚Üí 
    [Blob Storage for file] +
    [Structured JSON for metadata] ‚Üí
        [Power Automate / Dataverse / SharePoint / Teams]
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Next Step

Would you like:

* A **ready-to-use C# Azure Function** to handle this upload?
* Integration into **Blob Storage + JSON metadata output**?
* A follow-up that sends that metadata to **Power Automate via webhook**?

Great idea ‚Äî using an LLM to score resumes against job descriptions is **a powerful and scalable way** to enhance your hiring process. Now, let‚Äôs break down how to approach this and whether to use **Power Automate** or **extend your Azure Function**.

---

## ‚úÖ Short Answer

üëâ **Extend your Azure Function** to include the LLM scoring logic.
**Why?**

* You already have the resume and job description together at the point of upload.
* Azure Function can directly call **Azure OpenAI** (or OpenAI API) with full control.
* Power Automate is better for no-code orchestration but **less suitable for LLM processing at scale or with file content**.

---

## üß© Suggested Flow

```plaintext
[Candidate Form Submission]
      ‚Üì
[Azure Function]
  - Parse resume file (PDF/Docx)
  - Extract job ID (or job description)
  - Call LLM (OpenAI/Azure OpenAI)
  - Score match % based on skills, experience
  - Return/store result
      ‚Üì
[Save to SharePoint / Dataverse / trigger Teams alert]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Why Azure Function is the Right Place for LLM

| Feature                     | Power Automate         | Azure Function                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Resume file parsing         | ‚ùå Limited              | ‚úÖ Full control                 |
| LLM integration             | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic via connector | ‚úÖ Direct OpenAI API            |
| Token control               | ‚ùå No                   | ‚úÖ Yes                          |
| Custom scoring prompt logic | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited             | ‚úÖ Full power                   |
| Cost & performance control  | ‚ùå Not efficient        | ‚úÖ Better for batch and compute |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What You'll Need in Azure Function

### 1. **Parse Resume File**

* Use `PdfSharp`, `iTextSharp`, or `DocumentFormat.OpenXml` (for `.docx`) to extract raw text.

### 2. **Job Description Input**

* Passed in the form (or fetched from your system by job ID).

### 3. **Call OpenAI API**

* Craft a prompt like:

```plaintext
Job Description:
<...>

Resume:
<...>

Evaluate how well the resume matches the job. Return a score from 0‚Äì100 and mention missing or matched skills.
```

* Use `HttpClient` to send to OpenAI.

### 4. **Process Response**

* Store candidate info + score in SharePoint, Dataverse, or trigger Power Automate for human review.

---

## üß† Bonus Ideas

* Auto-tag candidates based on score.
* Auto-advance top 80% scorers for review.
* Run resume + LinkedIn profile comparison (if link provided).

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

Would you like:

* A **sample Azure Function** in C# that:

  * Parses resume PDF
  * Accepts job description
  * Calls OpenAI
  * Returns score + summary
* OR a **clean interface for your recruiters to review results** in Power Apps?

Great ‚Äî since you're already using **Together AI** and interested in **minimizing cost**, using **LLaMA 3 via Together AI** for resume scoring is definitely feasible, but with a few **key implementation differences** compared to OpenAI.

---

## ‚úÖ Short Answer

Yes, you can use **Together AI + LLaMA 3** to:

* Ingest parsed resume text (you'll need to extract it yourself).
* Compare it with a job description.
* Get a **match score and analysis** using a custom prompt.

But:
**Together AI does not support file upload or auto-document parsing like OpenAI** ‚Äî you'll need to **preprocess the file** (PDF/Docx) yourself in the Azure Function before sending the text to the model.

---

## üß© How It Works with Together AI

### üîπ Your Role (in Azure Function)

1. **Parse uploaded resume** into plain text.

   * Use `PdfSharp`, `iText7`, `Aspose.PDF`, or `OpenXml` (for `.docx`).
2. **Fetch/receive job description** (from SharePoint, DB, or part of submission).
3. **Craft a prompt** that feeds both:

   * `Resume text`
   * `Job description`
   * Ask the model to return a structured JSON with:

     * Match percentage
     * Matching skills
     * Missing skills

### üîπ Together AI API

Call their `chat/completions` endpoint using LLaMA 3 (`meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat` or `Llama-3-8b-chat`):

**POST [https://api.together.xyz/v1/chat/completions](https://api.together.xyz/v1/chat/completions)**

```json
{
  "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an expert recruiter helping assess candidate resumes."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Given the following resume and job description, provide a match score (0-100), list matching and missing skills.\n\nResume:\n<resume text>\n\nJob Description:\n<job description>"
    }
  ],
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "top_p": 0.9,
  "max_tokens": 1024
}
```

> üîê You‚Äôll need to use your Together AI API key in the `Authorization` header.

There currently aren't any well‚Äëmaintained, modern open‚Äësource Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) built in C#. Most popular open‚Äësource ATS platforms use PHP (like OpenCATS) or JavaScript/TypeScript stacks.

---

### üîç Known Open-Source ATS Options

* **OpenCATS** (PHP/MySQL)
  A mature, self-hosted ATS. While not in C#, it‚Äôs widely used and actively maintained ([OpenCATS][1]).

* **FreeATS**, **iKrut**, **HireList**, etc.
  These are also PHP or other stacks‚Äînot C#. ([LinuxWays][2]).

* **Staff‚ÄØOptima**, **OpenATS**
  Both modern, but built in TypeScript/Node or serverless JS ([GitHub][3]).

---

### üõ† C#‚Äëcentric Alternatives?

**SplendidCRM** is an open‚Äësource CRM built in ASP‚ÄØ.NET (C#) . It‚Äôs not an ATS per se, but you could:

* Use its C#/.NET foundation as a base.
* Extend it with modules for candidate pipelines, resume parsing, interview stages, etc.

---

### ‚úÖ Possible Paths

1. **Adapt an existing C# CRM**
   Customize SplendidCRM or another .NET open‚Äësource CRM to add ATS features (job posting, application pipelines, resume handling).

2. **Build from scratch in C#/.NET**
   You could implement basic ATS functionality: job listings, candidate tracking, interviews, offer status. You can use .NET Core Web API + EF Core + a component UI library.

---

### TL;DR

No ready-made, open-source ATS in C# right now. The closest is to adapt a C# CRM like SplendidCRM or build a lightweight ATS in .NET yourself.
